<p> The only idea i had about robots that changes was the look of them. Something I'm really excited about is all the different things i can do with thr robot and how i van change what it does. I am nervous about the precision that is a part of robotics because i tend to make little mistakes.Something that worked really 
well in our groups was how we each tried individually so we could understand it, but we still helped each other out. </p>
